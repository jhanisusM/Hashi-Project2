                                            <br>
                                            <br> Getting Started Before this course, I explain a little bit about coding to my
                                            mother. She mentioned her business with horse racing and how she wanted a cleaner
                                            way to manage her business.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> ###Prerequisites
                                            <br>
                                            <br> She wanted a website that functions as a database and accessible site for all
                                            her horse related business. This would allow her to manage all the horses she
                                            owns, and track the earnings.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Upon thinking about this, I thought of some additions to this online database
                                            for her by adding the last 3 rankings of the last 3 races, having an active/non-active
                                            list, separate last earnings and total earnings, turf/dirt list, and adding links
                                            to licensing, horse naming, and registering for races.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> We will use MySQL for the database and use Node and Express.js to allow the
                                            user to post/read/update/and delete information.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> We also would like to make a database which acts as a jockey roster so she can
                                            see which jockeys ride their horses and which horses they ride as well.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Our goal is to make this site an all for one shop to allow horse owners to look
                                            at their horse roster, Create/Read/Update/Delete aspects of the database, while
                                            also allowing her to easily access the links to register her new horses' names,
                                            obtain and renew licensing, and register horses for races. Also adding a side
                                            roster of the jockeys too.
                                            <br>
                                            <br> Future Plans We hope to make this site as user friendly and accessible to someone
                                            like my mom who is not a tech person, to easily manage her business.
